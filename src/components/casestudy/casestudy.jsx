							Sliike is a platform that enables customers hire the service of seasoned
							beauticians. Beauticians can also signup on Sliike so as to grow their businesses.
							In the new landing page, I set out to solve the problems below in 1 and a half months.
							The results were amazing.

					<div className="cs1-header"><h1>My Role</h1></div>
					<div className="cs1-body">
							<p>
							I made the designs, user testing and development of this project from end to end.
							I also collaborated with the web developers to ensure that my ideas were clearly 
							communicated.

					<div className="cs1-body">
							<p>
							Sliike's growth was stagnant over a period of time. To reach new clients and customers,
							some challenges that hindered it's growth needed to be addressed.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h3>The old landing page was not looking attractive.</h3>
							<p>
							<br/>
							While Sliike prided on good quality service as a big brand it's website needed to project 
							that image.
							</p><br/>
							<h3>Attract it's target demographic.</h3>
							<p>
							<br/>
							The website needed to capture the attention of the black community in Canada. We wish to 
							have about 90% blacks as customers and clients.
							</p><br/>
							<h3>Appealing user dashboard.</h3>
							<p>
							<br/>
							While the overall website needed a facelift, customers and clients needed to have a good
							user experience in the course of business transactions.
							</p><br/>
							<h3>Promote Sliike's mobile app.</h3>
							<p>
							<br/>
							The app was one of Sliike's selling point. The website needed to drive up Sliike's app downloads.
							</p><br/>
					</div>
					<div className="cs1-header"><h1>Goal</h1></div>
					<div className="cs1-body">
							<p>
							For Sliike's UI Design to be achieved, the following milestones needed to be reached.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Communicate Sliike's value proposition</h3>
							<p>
							<br/>
							To give clearer messaging about the brand and why they stand out.
							</p><br/>
							<h3>Attract it's target demographic.</h3>
							<p>
							<br/>
							The website needed to capture the attention of the black community in Canada. We wish to 
							have about 90% blacks as customers and clients.
							</p><br/>
							<h3>Making the website user-friendly.</h3>
							<p>
							<br/>
							We wanted the users to spend more time on the website, not just because of the services but 
							because they enjoy the experience when using the website.
							</p><br/>
							<h3>Drive Sliike's mobile app downloads.</h3>
							<p>
							<br/>
							We want to convert users from web to app, so that they enjoy a better experience,
							and we could focus our resources on the app instead of maintaining several platforms.
